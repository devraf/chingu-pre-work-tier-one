            <p class="card-text">
              So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for
              the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the
              pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of
              getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit
              with pink eyes ran close by her.
            </p>
            <p class="card-text">
              There was nothing so VERY remarkable in that; nor did Alice think
              it so VERY much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself,
              `Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!' (when she thought it over
              afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at
              this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural); but when the
              Rabbit actually TOOK A WATCH OUT OF ITS WAISTCOAT- POCKET, and
              looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for
              it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit
              with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and
              burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and
              fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large
              rabbit-hole under the hedge.
